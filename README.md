The Iris Classification project is a machine learning project that aims to classify iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on the length and width of their sepals and petals. This is a classic example of a multiclass classification problem and is often used as a beginner's dataset for machine learning.The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples with four features each: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Each sample is labeled with one of three classes: setosa, versicolor, or virginica.
